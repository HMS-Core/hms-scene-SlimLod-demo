## Introduction

The Slim Mesh is a component of the Scene Kit of Huawei HMS Core components. The Slim Mesh plug-in facilitates developers to simplify the processing of mesh data and supports the processing of meshes with vertex and index information.

This sample code demonstrates how to invoke external interfaces of SlimMesh to perform mesh simplification.

## Environments Requirements

Supports 64-bit operating systems.

## Result

The command line output is as follows:

```batch
SlimMesh result = 6
```

Note: In the command output, result indicates the number of vertex indexes after mesh simplification.
